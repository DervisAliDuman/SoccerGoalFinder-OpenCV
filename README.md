I blurred image then reformatted image BGR to HSV.
For the color mask, it needs HSV values. So, I used HSV tracker for the right range of color.

There is white spaces when we applied a mask in that specific color detected places.
Lastly found contours for finding biggest white space and itâ€™s center.
